# Data Collected

## BERT Data
While BERT did transmit information, it was sporadic. However, the vital landing information was transmitted. BERT did NOT record data, the file had zero bytes. Cause is unknown at this time

## HAR Data
HAR Data was collected. HAR failed to transmit to Mission Control around 22K feet. This is being investigated but part of the problem seems to be with the pointing system for the antenna.

### Atmospheric Data
Below is the temperature data recorded. This was recorded with the onboard temperature since located on the Clue board. This board was located in a plastic case with a clear window on it. This would not accurately represent atmospheric temperature.
